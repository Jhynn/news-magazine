# News magazine

That's the backend for a news manager system, this manager covers all the essential for publish news, posts, blogs, tutorials, articles reviews and the like. In addition a friend of mine, [Houston](https://github.com/houstonsbarros/), made a [front-end client](https://github.com/houstonsbarros/news_magazine) for this backend, so you can use it _already_.
